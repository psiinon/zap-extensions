<H1>LLM Support</H1>

This optional add-on integrates LLM with ZAP. It allows you to configure ZAP to connect to an LLM of your choosing,
and provides hooks for other add-ons to access the LLM.
<p>
ZAP will not share any data with LLMs unless you choose to install this add-on, and configure it to connect to a supported LLM.
<p>
All communications with LLMs will be shown in a sub-tab of the main Output tab.
<p>
This add-on provides the following functionality:

<H2>LLM Chat</H2>
An interactive chat interface that allows you to communicate directly with the configured LLM. You can ask questions, get explanations, and receive assistance in real-time. See the <a href="chat.html">LLM Chat</a> help page for more details.

<H2>Appending Data to Chat</H2>
Right-click menu items allow you to quickly append ZAP data to the LLM Chat input area:
<ul>
    <li><b>Append Alert to LLM Chat:</b> Available when right-clicking on alerts. Appends formatted alert information including risk, confidence, description, evidence, and URI. Supports appending multiple selected alerts.</li>
    <li><b>Append Request to LLM Chat:</b> Available when right-clicking on HTTP messages. Appends the HTTP request (headers and body) to the chat.</li>
    <li><b>Append Response to LLM Chat:</b> Available when right-clicking on HTTP messages. Appends the HTTP response (headers and body) to the chat.</li>
    <li><b>Append Request &amp; Response to LLM Chat:</b> Available when right-clicking on HTTP messages. Appends both the request and response to the chat.</li>
</ul>
When data is appended, the chat panel automatically switches to the chat tab and positions the cursor at the end of the appended text, ready for you to add questions or send the message.
